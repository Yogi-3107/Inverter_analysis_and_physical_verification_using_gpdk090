### Inverter Design, Analysis and Physical Verification using Cadence provided GPDK090 in Cadence Virtuoso
---

In this project, I'm designing a _CMOS Inverter_, which will be analysed using various simulations. Also, a **layout** will be designed for the same followed by _Physical Verification_ steps like _Design-Rule-Check_ (**DRC**), _Layout-Vs-Schematic_ (**LVS**) and _Parasitic/RC Extraction_ (**RCX**). Further,  the results from _Pre-Layout simulation_ will be compared with the _Post-Layout simulation_ and the design will be _streamed-out/tape-out_.

## 2. CMOS Inverter

### 2.1 Schematic

**Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor** (CMOS) Inverter is a fundamental building block in VLSI (**Very Large Scale Integration**) design. Its primary purpose is to _convert input signals into complementary output signals_. This conversion is achieved by leveraging the unique properties of complementary transistors, one **P-channel** and one **N-channel**, to efficiently switch between _logic states (high and low)_. CMOS inverters play a crucial role in _logic gates, amplifiers, and memory circuits_, facilitating signal processing and data manipulation in various electronic devices and systems. Additionally, they offer advantages such as _low power consumption, high noise immunity, and compatibility_ with modern semiconductor manufacturing processes.

![CMOS INV SCHEMATIC](./Schematic%20and%20Symbol/Inverter_Schematic.png)

Image above illustrates the schematic of a typical CMOS Inverter, consisting a **PMOS and NMOS 1V threshold voltage** models from GPDK090 library.
- The schematic shows two transistors tied up in series between the ground (**vss**) and the power(**vdd**) source in it.
- Unlike PMOS transistors where the source is linked to power supply and the drain is tied to the output , an NMOS transistorâ€™s source is directly linked with earth while its drain is linked with output .
- The input to the inverter is actually a mutual connection between the gates of the two transistors.

### 2.2 Symbol

![SYM WITH TT](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240427161407/constructiondrawio.png)

The image above shows the symbol used in the circuits to simply represent a CMOS Inverter. Along with the symbol, the truth table for the CMOS logic is also given to better understand its working.

**Working of CMOS Inverter:**
- **Input High (Logic 1)**: An NMOS transistor is turned on by input of high voltage (logic 1) while a PMOS transistor is turned off there. When these two things happen, the output voltage (logic 0) is lowered through reduced resistance path between an output terminal and ground.
- **Input Low (Logic 0)**: In contrast, when a low voltage (logic 0) is provided to the input terminal, the NMOS transistor switches off and the PMOS transistor conducts. The output voltage (logic 1) rises as a result of the low resistance path that exists between the output terminal and the positive power supply voltage (**vdd**).
- The CMOS inverter operates more easily because of the complimentary characteristics of the NMOS and PMOS transistors. Because one of the transistors conducts while the other is off depending on the input voltage, the output of the transistors is inverted with respect to the input signal.
- CMOS inverters offer very low static power dissipation (no DC current flows between VDD and ground while the input is at a constant logic level) as a result of this complimentary pairing.

Below is the symbol designed in Cadence Virtuoso, that will be utilized in analysing the characteristics of the circuit.

## 3. Analysis of CMOS Inverter

### 3.1 Characteristics of CMOS Inveter

**Dynamic Characteristics**

![DYNAMIC CHAR](https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/Dynamic-Characteristics-of-CMOS-Inverter.jpg)

The characteristics plotted on the graph after _Transient analysis_ is typically called **Dynamic Characteristics** of a CMOS Inverter, as we study the dynamics of the designed circuit.

**Static Characteristics**

![VTC](https://player.slideplayer.com/85/13705706/slides/slide_11.jpg)

Also referred as **Voltage-Transfer-Characteristics** (VTC), is used to measure quality of an inverter by plotting a _voltage transfer curve_ between the input voltage (_in_) and output voltage (_out_).

### 3.2 Transient and DC Analysis

![ANALYSIS SYMBOL](./Transient%20and%20DC%20Analysis/Tran_and_DC_Sim_Schematic.png)

I connected a DC Voltage supply of **1.8 V** across terminal _vdd_ and _vss_ of the inverter and give a pulsating signal as an input (Lower Voltage - **0** and Higher Voltage - **1.8 V**) to test the working of the circuit.

Below is the graphical representation of **Transient** (_left_) and **DC** (_right_) Analysis of a CMOS Inverter. Both are **Pre-Layout** Simulations, i.e., the analysis is done before we extract the **RC parasitics** for the designed circuit. **Green** trace represents the _input_ and **Red** represents the _output_.

![PRE LAYOUT SIM](./Transient%20and%20DC%20Analysis/Tran_and_DC_Sim_Plot.png)

**Transient Analysis**

- Transient behaviour of the Inverter is shown above in the figure (_left_). It shows how the inverter responds to changes in input signal over time, which is crucial for circuit speed and efficiency. It occurs due to effective charging and discharging of the output node of the CMOS inverters due to the quick switching speeds offered by complementary NMOS and PMOS transistors.
- This rapid charging and discharging accounts for the delay in the propagation of the output signal with respect to the recieved input signal, which is called **Propagation Delay**.

Propagation Delay can be calculated using the following formula:

![Formula Prop](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_%7Bp%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bt_%7Bphl%7D+%2B+t_%7Bplh%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=000&s=0&c=20201002)

where **tp** is _Propagation Delay_, **tphl** is _delay in the signal when output swtiches from high to low_ and **tplh** is _delay in the signal when output swithces from low to high_.

![TRAN DELAY1](./Transient%20and%20DC%20Analysis/Tran_Delay1.png)
![TRAN DELAY2](./Transient%20and%20DC%20Analysis/Tran_Delay2.png)

For the transient simulation above, the delay came out out to be **20.049 ns**.

**DC Analysis**

- Static Behaviour of the Inverter is shown above in the analysis response (_right_). It shows how the output voltage changes with the input voltage. The threshold voltage is the point at which the output states abruptly change from high to low. The production decreases below this level and stays high above it.
- The VTC is like an upside down step function because of the increased accuracy in turning ON/OFF transitions. Quality in the transition region is suggested by the existence of well-defined slopes that enable precise switching.

To ensure balanced functioning, CMOS inverters should ideally provide a symmetric VTC around the midpoint voltage. For this, we vary the width of the PMOS to find an ideal width at which our CMOS design provides a symmetric VTC. This is called a **Symmetric CMOS**, and its **switching threshold** (_midpoint of VTC_) is **half of the supply voltage** (_vdd_). The plot for the same is shown below:

![DC Sim Symmetric](./Transient%20and%20DC%20Analysis/DC_Analysis_for_Symmetric_Conditions.png)

The width of the PMOS at which the symmetric condition of the CMOS is fulfilled, comes out to be **Wp = 1.15 um**. At this point, the swtiching threshold is nearly equal to half of the supply voltage (**vdd**).
